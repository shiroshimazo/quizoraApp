# Teacher Quiz Statistics

> Status: Planned Swing feature specification. Named classes and reuse points below are design targets, not verified existing code.

The Quiz Statistics sidebar opens an all-time comparison of the signed-in teacher's quizzes, including clearly labeled archived quizzes. Choose a quiz or All quizzes; the selection applies to KPI cards, charts and the comparison table. Refresh preserves the selected quiz if it still belongs to the teacher.

- Attempts includes in-progress and submitted attempts, with retakes counted separately.
- Submitted includes unscored submitted attempts.
- Completion rate is submitted attempts divided by all attempts; no attempts displays N/A.
- Average score is the mean finalized submitted attempt percentage. The overall average weights each quiz average by its scored attempt count. No scored attempts displays N/A.
- The bar chart compares average scores for up to eight quizzes with the most scored submissions. IDs distinguish duplicate titles; tooltips show the title, score and scored count.
- The pie chart separates submitted and in-progress attempts.
- The line chart shows the last 14 database-calendar days, including zero days. It uses the selected quiz scope and excludes dates outside the window.
- The sortable table retains quizzes without attempts and includes status, attempt/submission/scored counts and average score.

QuizStatisticsDAO verifies active, non-archived teacher access and reads a consistent transaction snapshot. Database work runs off the Swing Event Dispatch Thread (EDT). Refresh clears previous data, controls are disabled while loading, and callbacks reject session changes. No schema changes are required.

## Planned verification

No implementation or test suite for this feature is present in this workspace.
Verify the behavior above with Service/DAO tests and Swing UI checks, including
role isolation, session changes, loading/error states, and responsive layout.
