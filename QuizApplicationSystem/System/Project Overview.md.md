## Project Title
Quiz Application System

## Overview

The Quiz Application System is a desktop-based application developed to automate the process of creating, managing, and taking quizzes. The system aims to replace traditional paper-based assessments by providing a digital platform where administrators, teachers, and students can efficiently manage and conduct quizzes.

The system provides different features based on user roles. Administrators manage users, quizzes, subjects, accounts, and system records. Teachers create and manage quizzes, questions, and monitor student performance. Students can access available quizzes, complete assessments, and view their results.

The system uses a database to securely store user information, quiz questions, answers, and assessment results. Through automation, the system improves the accuracy of scoring, reduces manual work, and provides a more organized assessment process.

## Workspace status and organization

The current source contains only `Source/QuizoraApp/quizoraApp.java` with an empty main method. NetBeans/Ant targets Java 26; no JDBC driver, UI assets, schema scripts, or tests are present. The behavior above describes the intended system.

See [Recommended Folder Structure](Recommended%20Folder%20Structure.md) for the Swing implementation layout.
